								<p>First stop on the list was a little spot tucked away in a farmers market called Winter Park Biscuit Co. A 100% vegan menu offers plenty of options to satisfy a hungry stomach of all sizes. With hours noted at 11am - 7pm, you can soothe the craving for brunch, lunch, or dinner items. We arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and the line was already out the door. To make sure we didn't miss out on any of the staples, Julio and I chose The OG (crispy chik cutlet on an Oat Buttermild Biscuit with vegan honey), Death Valley Chik Sandwich (Crispy chik cutlet, Dry Spice, Pickled Jalepenos & Mayo on a toasted Brioche Bun), Buffalo Chik Sub (Crispy Chik with lettuce, tomato, onion, dill ranch, & vinaigrette on an Olde Hearth Hero), and last but not least the Loaded Fries (vegan crumbles, vegan american cheese sauce, WPBC sauce, and scallions).</p>
								<p>Everything we received was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be going again. Here our some of our opinions on each dish. First, we split the loaded fries as we didn't think they would heat up well for leftovers. The crumbles and the cheese sauce both had incredible flavors that blended well together and we simply could not stop eating them. Next we each sampled the Death Valley sandwich and the Buffalo Chik Sub. Both were amazing with their own individual styles. The Death Valley dry rub seasoning is to die for and really brought this sandwich to another level. We both easily agree that this is better than any chain chicken sandwich out there. The Buffalo sub had a bit of a spice to it but it was *just* the right amount. Not too spicy (I can't handle to much spice) and not too mild that you felt wanting. We finished the Death Valley sandwich on the spot, but later that night we re-heated the Buffalo sub in the airfryer and it was still perfect. Lastly, the OG biscuit was again delicious. Our only complaint here was that the biscuit itself was a bit crumbly and we ended up eating the whole thing with a fork. Flavors were out of this world though. All in all, we will definitely be returning for more and we recommend you try them out if your in the area. </p>
